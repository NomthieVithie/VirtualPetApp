The code implements a simple Android application that allows users to interact with a virtual pet. 
Users can feed, clean, and play with the pet, which affects the pet's status metrics: hunger, happiness, and cleanliness.
The app updates the visual representation of the pet based on user actions.

CODE Structure:Package Declaration: 
The code is encapsulated in the package com.example.assignment2. Imports: Essential Android libraries are imported for UI elements and activity management. 
Main Activity Class: MainActivity2 inherits from AppCompatActivity, which is a common base class for activities in Android.
Variables for the pet's status (hunger, happy, and clean) are initialized with default values.

Here is a breakdown of the code structure of the app 
Components:

Model: The pet's state is represented by three integer variables: hunger, happy, and clean. These variables store the pet's current levels of hunger, happiness, and cleanliness, respectively.
View: The user interface consists of buttons (btnFeed, btnClean, btnPlay) for interacting with the pet, TextViews (txtHunger, txtHappy, txtClean) to display the pet's status, and an ImageView (imageView2) to show the pet's image.
Controller: The MainActivity2 class acts as the controller, handling user input and updating both the model (pet's state) and the view (UI elements).
Functionality:

Hunger Management:
Feeding the pet increases its hunger and happiness levels.
The current hunger level is displayed in the txtHunger TextView.

Cleanliness Maintenance:
Cleaning the pet increases its cleanliness level.
The current cleanliness level is displayed in the txtClean TextView.

Happiness Enhancement:
Playing with the pet increases its happiness level.
The current happiness level is displayed in the txtHappy TextView.
Image Feedback:

The pet's image is updated to reflect its current activity (eating, bathing, or playing).
User Interface:

The app's intuitive UI includes:

Three buttons for feeding, cleaning, and playing.
TextViews for displaying hunger, happiness, and cleanliness levels.
An ImageView for showing the pet's image.
Code Review:

Strengths:

Simplicity: The code is straightforward and easy to understand.
Encapsulation: The pet's state is encapsulated within the MainActivity2 class, promoting code organization.
Event Handling: The use of OnClickListeners ensures a responsive user experience.
Weaknesses:

Hardcoded Values: The initial values for hunger, happiness, and cleanliness are fixed.
Lack of Constraints: There are no upper limits for the status variables.
No Decrementing Logic: The pet's needs don't automatically decrease over time.
Potential Improvements:

Dynamic State Management: Introduce a timer to decrease status levels gradually and set upper limits for each variable.
Enhanced User Feedback: Add sound effects, animations, or notifications.
State Persistence: Save the pet's state using SharedPreferences or a database.
User Customization: Allow users to personalize the pet's appearance and name.

Conclusion:
The Virtual Pet App provides a basic framework for a virtual pet experience. 
By addressing the identified weaknesses and incorporating the suggested improvements, the app can evolve into a more engaging and immersive experience for users.
